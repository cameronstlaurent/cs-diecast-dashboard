# CS Diecast Dashboard

CS Diecast design and build done by Cameron St. Laurent. Not much to do here yet but there will be soon! Some details on what you can do right now is provided below. 

# Technology used
This dashboard was built using the react framework. Utilizes redirects, style components and vanilla CSS to create the styling of the page(s). This project is hosted on Netlify where it will be updated with new features, so stay tuned! 

# How it works
When you provide login credidentials on the login page you will be brought to the dashboard where you can add products to the storefront. If you type in a wrong address you will be brought to a 404 page. Ex: cs-diecast-dashboard.netify.app/tokyo_drift. Clicking the sign out button at the bottom of the side bar will take you back to the login page. 


## Licensing 
All content used in this project is for educational purposes only. the only asset I own is the image on the login page.
