# Collectible diecast storefront built with vanilla JavaScript and Firebase RTD
Create, read, update, read and delete data through the CS Diecast storefront dashboard. First draft of this project as it will later be built using the React framework. 

## How to use it
### Create
Create an item and upload it to the real time database using the "add product" link inside the sidebar on the left.
### Read
When you add a new product, the item will be displayed on the index.html page with the data you have inputed inside of a card. 
### Update
Update an item by clicking the edit button on one of the cards and changing the data populated in the form fields. Make sure to update the image while doing so though!
### Delete
Delete an item by clicking the delete button inside the cards. You will be given two options: 
- Delete
- Exit

Clicking delete will delete the item from the real time database, clicking exit will take you back to the index.html page
